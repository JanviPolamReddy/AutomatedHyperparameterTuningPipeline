Introduction:
In this project, I implemented an automated hyperparameter tuning pipeline using skorch and scikit-optimize to optimize the performance of a neural network classifier. The goal was to streamline the process of hyperparameter tuning and find the best configuration for maximizing model performance on a given dataset.

Abstract:
Automated Hyperparameter Tuning Pipeline addresses the challenge of optimizing hyperparameters for machine learning models efficiently and effectively. Traditional manual tuning methods can be time-consuming and often require domain expertise, making them impractical for large-scale or complex models. This project proposes a pipeline-based approach that leverages automated optimization techniques such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms to search for the optimal hyperparameters automatically.

Problem Statement:
The problem involved optimizing the hyperparameters of a neural network classifier to achieve the highest possible accuracy on a binary classification task. I aimed to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and identify optimal configurations.

Dataset:
I used a synthetic dataset generated using make_classification from sklearn.datasets for demonstration purposes. The dataset consisted of 1000 samples with 20 features and 2 classes. I split the dataset into training and validation sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

Automated Hyperparameter Tuning Pipeline:
1.Neural Network Model Definition:
Defined a feedforward neural network (NeuralNetwork) using torch.nn.Module with configurable hyperparameters such as hidden layer size and dropout rate.
2.Model Creation Function:
Created a function (create_model) that returned a NeuralNetClassifier instance with default and tunable hyperparameters.
3.Hyperparameter Optimization:
Implemented a function (optimize_hyperparameters) to optimize hyperparameters using BayesSearchCV from scikit-optimize. The function searched for the best hyperparameter configuration by evaluating model performance using cross-validation.
4.Optimized Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the performance of the optimized model using the best hyperparameters obtained from the tuning process on a validation set.

Results and Discussion:
The automated hyperparameter tuning pipeline successfully identified the best set of hyperparameters (best_params) that maximized the classification accuracy of the neural network on the validation dataset. The use of Bayesian optimization (BayesSearchCV) allowed efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space, leading to improved model performance without exhaustive search.
